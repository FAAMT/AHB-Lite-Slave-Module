# AHB-Lite-Slave-Module

This is an AHB Slave Module that I simulated and synthesized using QuestaSim software. It is a small sample of my Verilog experience and I have learned a lot more since this project. 
I will eventually put up more of my designs, for now feel free to poke around this repo and observe my early coding habits in Verilog. The top level source code is in: ahb_lite_slave.sv
