As this is supposed to be used to grade a functional design that you have
already throughly tested, the advanced test cases will not contribute points
to your score until all of the Basic and Error test cases are 100% satisfied.
Additionally the results of the advanced test cases will not be reported to
you until all of the Basic and Error test cases are 100% satisfied.
